    # Google Ads Query Language (GAQL) Reference
    
    GAQL is similar to SQL but with specific syntax for Google Ads. Here's a quick reference:
    
    ## Basic Query Structure
    ```
    SELECT field1, field2, ... 
    FROM resource_type
    WHERE condition
    ORDER BY field [ASC|DESC]
    LIMIT n
    ```
    
    ## Common Field Types
    
    ### Resource Fields
    - campaign.id, campaign.name, campaign.status
    - ad_group.id, ad_group.name, ad_group.status
    - ad_group_ad.ad.id, ad_group_ad.ad.final_urls
    - keyword.text, keyword.match_type
    
    ### Metric Fields
    - metrics.impressions
    - metrics.clicks
    - metrics.cost_micros
    - metrics.conversions
    - metrics.ctr
    - metrics.average_cpc
    
    ### Segment Fields
    - segments.date
    - segments.device
    - segments.day_of_week
    
    ## Common WHERE Clauses
    
    ### Date Ranges
    - WHERE segments.date DURING LAST_7_DAYS
    - WHERE segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS
    - WHERE segments.date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31'
    
    ### Filtering
    - WHERE campaign.status = 'ENABLED'
    - WHERE metrics.clicks > 100
    - WHERE campaign.name LIKE '%Brand%'
    
    ## Tips
    - Always check account currency before analyzing cost data
    - Cost values are in micros (millionths): 1000000 = 1 unit of currency
    - Use LIMIT to avoid large result sets

    I'll help you analyze your Google Ads account data. Here's the recommended workflow:
    
    1. First, let's list all the accounts you have access to:
       - Run the `list_accounts()` tool to get available account IDs
    
    2. Before analyzing cost data, let's check which currency the account uses:
       - Run `get_account_currency(customer_id="ACCOUNT_ID")` with your selected account
    
    3. Now we can explore the account data:
       - For campaign performance: `get_campaign_performance(customer_id="ACCOUNT_ID", days=30)`
       - For ad performance: `get_ad_performance(customer_id="ACCOUNT_ID", days=30)`
       - For ad creative review: `get_ad_creatives(customer_id="ACCOUNT_ID")`
    
    4. For custom queries, use the GAQL query tool:
       - `run_gaql(customer_id="ACCOUNT_ID", query="YOUR_QUERY", format="table")`
    
    5. Let me know if you have specific questions about:
       - Campaign performance
       - Ad performance
       - Keywords
       - Budgets
       - Conversions
    
    Important: Always provide the customer_id as a string.
    For example: customer_id="1234567890"

    I'll help you write a Google Ads Query Language (GAQL) query. Here are some examples to get you started:
    
    ## Get campaign performance last 30 days
    ```
    SELECT
      campaign.id,
      campaign.name,
      campaign.status,
      metrics.impressions,
      metrics.clicks,
      metrics.cost_micros,
      metrics.conversions
    FROM campaign
    WHERE segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS
    ORDER BY metrics.cost_micros DESC
    ```
    
    ## Get keyword performance
    ```
    SELECT
      keyword.text,
      keyword.match_type,
      metrics.impressions,
      metrics.clicks,
      metrics.cost_micros,
      metrics.conversions
    FROM keyword_view
    WHERE segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS
    ORDER BY metrics.clicks DESC
    ```
    
    ## Get ads with poor performance
    ```
    SELECT
      ad_group_ad.ad.id,
      ad_group_ad.ad.name,
      campaign.name,
      ad_group.name,
      metrics.impressions,
      metrics.clicks,
      metrics.conversions
    FROM ad_group_ad
    WHERE 
      segments.date DURING LAST_30_DAYS
      AND metrics.impressions > 1000
      AND metrics.ctr < 0.01
    ORDER BY metrics.impressions DESC
    ```
    
    Once you've chosen a query, use it with:
    ```
    run_gaql(customer_id="YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID", query="YOUR_QUERY_HERE")
    ```
    
    Remember:
    - Always provide the customer_id as a string
    - Cost values are in micros (1,000,000 = 1 unit of currency)
    - Use LIMIT to avoid large result sets
    - Check the account currency before analyzing cost data
